#### just my custom documentation to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Rename the local master branch to main (default in [GitHub](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-the-default-branch-for-newly-created-repositories-is-now-main/) )

> git branch -m master main

if it is not working try to commit something to the master branch and try again
